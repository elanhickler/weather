## Aliasing wars: the Surge Oscillator

This branch (`aliasing-wars`) is a dedicated workspace for anti-aliased
oscillator work, starting with `native_modules/surge_oscillator` — a
saw/square/tri/sine oscillator with hard sync.

> 🎚️ The name is a play on the [**loudness war**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war) —
> the decades-long race among mastering engineers to make recordings louder
> and louder, at the cost of dynamic range. This branch is the same kind of
> arms race, fought over a different quantity: not loudness, but how much
> unwanted high-frequency garbage a digital oscillator sneaks in above
> Nyquist. Same shape of fight, aliasing instead of loudness.

**The problem.** Hard sync forces a slave oscillator's phase back to 0 every
time a master signal crosses zero going up. That forced reset is a
discontinuity injected mid-waveform, and rendering it naively (just snapping
`phase = 0`, with no correction) aliases badly — the classic harsh, digital
buzz under a sync sweep.

**The fix, in two parts:**

1. **PolyBLEP correction reused, not reinvented.** This sandbox's existing
   `polyblep.cpp` module already band-limits ordinary cycle wraps with a
   PolyBLEP correction. A sync-forced reset and a natural wrap are the same
   kind of event from the waveform function's point of view — phase lands
   near 0 — so `surge_oscillator.cpp` reuses the identical
   `polyBlep`/`polyBlepSquare`/triangle-integrator functions unchanged. Every
   reset, sync-forced or natural, gets band-limited for free.
2. **Sub-sample sync timing.** Sync input is read once per sample, but a real
   zero-crossing can happen anywhere within that sample. Instead of always
   resetting to exactly `phase = 0` (which quantizes sync timing to the
   sample rate and adds its own jitter/aliasing at high sync ratios), the
   module linearly interpolates the crossing time within the sample and
   starts the new cycle already `frac` of the way in — the same idea Surge
   and other analog-modeling synths use for sync-aware oscillators.

**Verified, not assumed.** The compiled `.wasm` is tested against a
Python + `wasmtime` harness exercising the real artifact directly (27
assertions: pool exhaustion, waveform selection, level scaling, edge-triggered
sync detection, and — the part that actually matters — proof that early vs.
late sync crossings within the same sample produce measurably different
output, confirming the sub-sample interpolation is doing real work and not a
no-op).

**Ports:** `0.1V/Oct` (pitch) and `Sync` (audio-rate signal; a rising
zero-crossing triggers the reset) in; `Out` (the selected waveform), `Saw`,
`Square`, `Tri`, `Sine` (always-on taps, like `polyblep.cpp`'s convention),
`Synced` (a one-sample-wide pulse on the sample where a sync reset fired,
for chaining/visualizing), and `Internal Sync` (the built-in master
oscillator's raw signal, for inspection) out. Native C++/WASM with a JS
fallback, wired into both the offline evaluator and the realtime audio
worklet.

**Built-in sync source.** Patching a real oscillator into `Sync` still
works, but most hard-sync sweeps don't need a second module just to get
one — the oscillator owns its own internal master oscillator (`Sync Freq`,
0–20000 Hz, same range as the audible `Frequency`). With nothing patched
into `Sync`, the internal oscillator's zero-crossings drive the exact same
sub-sample-interpolated reset path external audio would — a self-contained
hard-sync sweep with two knobs and zero patch cables. Patch something into
`Sync` and it takes over completely; the internal oscillator is a
convenience default, not an extra mandatory step.

## 🎛️ Alias-free oscillator study: the DSF technique

Studied `C:\Users\argit\Documents\_PROGRAMMING\soemdsp\include\soemdsp\oscillator\DSFOscillator.hpp`
(Walter Hackett's alias-free oscillator) as a second angle on the aliasing
mission, distinct from PolyBLEP.

**The core idea is fundamentally different from PolyBLEP.** PolyBLEP starts
from a naive discontinuous waveform (a hard saw/square edge) and *corrects*
the discontinuity after the fact with a band-limited step function. DSF
(Discrete Summation Formula) synthesis never generates the discontinuity in
the first place — it computes the waveform directly from a **closed-form
trigonometric sum** of a bounded number of harmonics (`numPartials_ =
Nyquist / frequency`, recalculated on every frequency change). Because the
partial count is derived from the Nyquist limit, the waveform is alias-free
*by construction* — there's nothing above Nyquist to alias, rather than
something being suppressed after the fact.

**What's in the file:**
- `DSFOscillatorBase` — shared machinery: a phase accumulator (`calculateState()`),
  a leaky integrator (`leak_`) that fades in the amplitude-adjusted output
  over time (looks aimed at taming attack transients), and a `Wire`-based
  parameter system (`pointTo()`/`slave()`) that lets multiple oscillator
  instances share phase and morph state — a lightweight master/slave
  patch-cable primitive, conceptually similar to this sandbox's node wires
  but scoped to parameter sharing rather than the whole graph.
- `DSFOscillatorSineSaw` — continuously morphs sine → saw via a single
  `morph_` parameter (0–1), which reshapes a `k_`/`k2_`/`k42_` coefficient
  set feeding the closed-form DSF sum.
- `DSFOscillatorSineSquare` — same idea, sine → square, with its own
  coefficient derivation and partial-count halving (`/ 2.0`).

### 🧮 How the equation was derived

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/dsf-derivation.svg" alt="Four-step derivation: an infinite geometrically-decaying harmonic sum is rewritten as a complex exponential, collapsed by the geometric series identity, and reduced to one closed-form trig equation" width="90%"/>
</div>

The derivation is genuinely elegant, and the trick is one line of algebra
doing all the work:

1. 🎵 **Start with the sound you actually want** — infinitely many harmonics,
   each quieter than the last by a fixed ratio `a` (0 ≤ a < 1):
   `y(θ) = Σ aⁿ·sin((n+1)θ)` for `n = 0…∞`. This is a real, audible,
   band-unlimited signal — completely impractical to compute directly,
   since it's an infinite sum.
2. 🌀 **Rewrite it with complex exponentials.** Euler's formula
   (`e^{ix} = cos x + i·sin x`) turns each `sin` term into the imaginary
   part of a complex exponential, and — this is the useful part — turns the
   whole sum into `Σ aⁿ e^{i(n+1)θ}`, which factors into
   `e^{iθ} · Σ (a·e^{iθ})ⁿ`.
3. 💥 **The geometric series identity collapses it.** `Σ rⁿ = 1/(1−r)` for
   any `|r| < 1`, summed to infinity — one of the oldest identities in
   algebra. Substituting `r = a·e^{iθ}` turns the *infinite sum* into *a
   single fraction*, no loop, no series, nothing left to add up.
4. ✅ **Take the imaginary part and you have your closed-form oscillator.**
   What comes out is one trigonometric expression in `θ`, `a`, and the
   partial count — exactly the shape of the `DSF()` function in the code
   (`k_` is `a`, `numPartials_` is the harmonic count, `dsfState_` is `θ`).
   Every sample, the oscillator evaluates that one closed-form line instead
   of summing any harmonics at all — which is *also* why it's fast: the
   "summation" in Discrete Summation Formula happened once, on paper, in
   1976, not once per sample at runtime.

The alias-free property falls out of the same math: because the harmonic
count feeding the closed form is derived from `Nyquist / frequency`, the
formula only ever represents harmonics that fit under Nyquist. There's
nothing above the limit to alias in the first place — the geometric series
identity that makes the equation *fast* is the same one that makes it
*clean*.

**The file is honest about its own problems** — the header comment block
lists them directly: attack causes an amplitude spike, volume is
inconsistent across `morph_` and across frequency, harmonics visibly "click"
in and out as frequency rises (consistent with `numPartials_` changing in
integer-ish steps with no smoothing between values), the saw/square volumes
don't match each other, and square gets dull at low frequency. None of these
are aliasing bugs — DSF's alias-free guarantee holds regardless — they're
amplitude-normalization and transient issues layered on top of a
mathematically sound core.

**Takeaway for this mission:** PolyBLEP (what Surge Oscillator uses) and DSF
solve the same problem from opposite directions — correct the edge vs. never
create the edge — and the tradeoffs are different too: DSF needs a live
partial-count recalculation per frequency change (cheap, but is exactly
where this implementation's harmonic "clicking" comes from), while PolyBLEP
needs a correction at every phase discontinuity, natural or sync-forced,
which is what `surge_oscillator.cpp` already does. A DSF-based module here
would be a genuinely different oscillator, not a redundant one — noted as
a real option for future work, not built in this pass.

## 🧪 The DSF starter kit

Built the study above into a real module: `native_modules/dsf_oscillator` —
one closed-form equation, six waveforms, two morph sliders. Native
C++/WASM with a JS fallback, wired into both the offline evaluator and the
realtime audio worklet, same as Surge Oscillator.

**One equation, reused for everything:**

```
DSF(x, a, N, fi) = (1 - a) · [sin(fi) - a·sin(x+fi) - aᴺ·sin(Nx+fi) + aᴺ⁻¹·sin((N-1)x+fi)]
                    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                        1 - 2a·cos(x) + a²
```

(the `(1 - a)` factor is an amplitude normalization — see the bug note below.)

**🎛️ The six waveforms:**

| Waveform | How it's built |
|---|---|
| 🎵 Sine | The trivial case — `sin(x)` directly, DSF not involved. |
| 🪚 Saw / Buzz | `DSF(x, a, N, 0)` — Moorer's original case, unmodified. |
| ⬛ Square | `DSF(x,a,N,0) − DSF(x+offset,a,N,0)`. Subtracting a phase-shifted copy of a saw cancels every even harmonic — the **PWM slider** *is* that offset, continuously swept. |
| 🎤 Formant | `DSF(x, a, N, fi)` — same equation, but the offset (also the PWM slider, reused) shifts *where* the harmonic emphasis sits instead of cancelling anything. This was DSF's original 1976 use case: vocal-formant-like spectra, not subtractive-synth shapes at all. |
| 📐 Triangle | A leaky integrator run over the Square case — same idea Surge Oscillator's PolyBLEP triangle tap uses. |
| 🌀 Fractal Stack | Three DSF saws at octave-spaced frequencies (`f, 2f, 4f`) with geometrically falling amplitude, summed. **Not** a real mathematical fractal (see the fractal-waveform discussion in this repo's chat history — DSF's closed form can't do genuine geometric-frequency self-similarity, since the whole trick depends on integer-multiple harmonics) — a cheap, *finite* self-similar cascade instead, same idea as this sandbox's `fractalBrownianNoise` module, built from oscillators instead of noise layers. |

**🎚️ The two morph sliders:**
- **Morph** sweeps the ratio `a` from near-0 (collapses toward a plain sine)
  up toward the harmonically rich end — "sine to full-harmonic oscillator"
  in one knob.
- **PWM** does double duty: pulse width / duty cycle for Square and
  Triangle, formant shift for Formant. Same offset parameter, different
  meaning depending on which waveform it's feeding.

**🐛 A real bug this build caught, not just theorized:** the very first
version had no amplitude normalization, and Formant mode measurably
clipped — the raw closed-form output peaked at **~2.44** against a
`±1.5` safety clamp, meaning ~18% of every cycle was flat-topped digital
clipping, not signal. Multiplying the whole equation by `(1 − a)` — the
standard DSF amplitude normalization — brought the peak down to **~1.0**,
verified by literally counting clamped samples before (39/220) and after
(0/220) the fix, in both the compiled `.wasm` and the JS mirror.

**Verified, not assumed:** 33 assertions against the real compiled `.wasm`
via Python + `wasmtime`, including actual FFT spectral proofs, not just
bounds-checking — Sine really is a single spectral peak, Square really
does suppress even harmonics by more than 5×, Morph really does add
measurable harmonic energy as it increases, PWM really does change duty
cycle, and the Fractal Stack really does put energy at its octave layers.

**🐛 A second real bug: the Harmonics slider itself could alias.** "Alias-free
by construction" only holds if the harmonic count actually stays under
Nyquist — the studied `DSFOscillatorBase` recalculates `numPartials_ =
halffreq_ / frequency_` every time frequency changes for exactly this
reason. This module's first version left `Harmonics` as a free 1–64 slider
with no such cap, so cranking it up at a moderately high pitch generated
real content above Nyquist, which folded back down as audible aliasing —
the exact thing this whole branch exists to fight. Measured directly: at
2000 Hz with `Harmonics = 64`, the formula was generating content up to
128 kHz against a 24 kHz Nyquist limit (48 kHz sample rate); only 99.46% of
the resulting spectral energy sat on the 12 harmonics that actually fit
under Nyquist before the fix. The fix: `Harmonics` is now a *ceiling*,
silently capped to `⌊Nyquist / frequency⌋` — same idea as the studied
file, just applied per-sample instead of only on frequency change. The
Fractal Stack's three octave layers each get their **own** independent cap
too (its `2f`/`4f` layers need a tighter cap than the base `f` layer, not
the same one). Added as a permanent regression test, not just a one-off
check: FFT-verified that Harmonics = 64 at 2000 Hz now stays alias-free.
