## 🎛️ Why analog filters

Every classic analog filter is a physical accident wearing a transfer
function. Resistors, capacitors, and transistors doing exactly what physics
demands of them — and what physics demands turns out to sound *incredible*
under stress: self-oscillating resonance, soft-clipping feedback loops,
component drift, asymmetric distortion on the way into saturation. None of
that is a bug. It's the entire reason a Moog ladder filter has a personality
and a textbook biquad doesn't.

This fork exists to chase that personality in `soemdsp`'s native C++/WASM
modules — not by approximating the *sound* from the outside, but by modeling
the *circuit* closely enough that the personality falls out on its own.

## 🧪 What makes them hard to get right in software

A naive digital filter is linear, time-invariant, and stable by construction.
A real analog filter is often none of those things, which is exactly what's
being chased here:

- **Nonlinearity.** Real transistor ladder stages saturate. A textbook
  digital filter doesn't, unless you deliberately put a nonlinearity back in
  — and where you put it changes the sound completely.
- **Self-oscillating resonance.** Push feedback gain high enough on a real
  Moog ladder and it turns into an oscillator, cleanly, on purpose. Getting
  a digital model to do the same without exploding numerically is the whole
  game.
- **Zero-delay feedback.** Naive digital translations of analog feedback
  loops introduce a one-sample delay that isn't in the real circuit, which
  audibly changes the resonant behavior. Topology-preserving transform (TPT)
  / zero-delay-feedback (ZDF) techniques exist specifically to close that gap.
- **Frequency-dependent nonlinear behavior.** Saturating a signal *before*
  filtering it sounds different from saturating *after* — and real circuits
  often do both, in a loop, simultaneously. That interaction is where a lot
  of the "expensive analog gear" character actually lives.
- **Aliasing from the nonlinear stages.** Any saturation stage generates
  harmonics; without oversampling, those harmonics fold back down as
  aliasing. Getting the nonlinear modeling right and getting the aliasing
  under control are two separate problems that have to be solved together.

## 🎚️ Filters on the list

| Filter | Status |
|---|---|
| **Moog Ladder** (4-pole transistor ladder, self-oscillating resonance) | 🔲 not started |
| **Diode Ladder** (TB-303-style, asymmetric diode nonlinearity) | 🔲 not started |
| **Sallen-Key** (2-pole op-amp topology, gentler slope) | 🔲 not started |
| **State-Variable Filter** (simultaneous LP/HP/BP/notch outputs) | 🔲 not started |
| **Twin-T Notch** (passive notch, the basis of classic phaser/wah circuits) | 🔲 not started |
| **Discrete Multimode Filter** (parallel 24dB LP / 24dB HP / 12dB BP / 12dB notch outputs, resonance from a feedback loop with an insert point in the path) | 🔲 not started |
| **Simultaneous LP/HP Filter** (one core filter stage driven as a 12dB lowpass and a separate highpass at once, each with its own audio input and level control, prized for a screaming self-oscillating character) | 🔲 not started |
| **Switchable Third-Order Filter** (three cascaded first-order sections, each switchable between lowpass and highpass, a mode switch selecting among four low-pass/band-pass/reversed-band-pass/high-pass combinations, and a voltage-controlled resonance amplifier that can be driven well past the onset of oscillation into chaotic and phase-locked territory, with taps available after each of the three stages) | 🔲 not started |
| **Diode-Controlled LP/HP Pair** (a highpass stage tracking at half rate paired with a lowpass stage tracking at full rate to form a bandpass-like sweep, with frequency set by diode control current rather than a transistor or OTA stage — which naturally narrows the usable sweep range — and matched capacitor pairs tuning the corner behavior) | 🔲 not started |

This table is the honest state of things: a target list, not a changelog.
Each filter gets the same treatment already proven out elsewhere in
`soemdsp-sandbox` — native C++ compiled to WASM, verified against the real
compiled artifact (not just a JS mirror) before it's wired into the graph.
