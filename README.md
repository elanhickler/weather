# soemdsp-sandbox

Read-only local sandbox shell for inspecting `soemdsp` demo handoff manifests.

This first shell consumes the generated bound WAV resync artifact packet from the sibling `soemdsp` repository. It displays manifest status, source file metadata, source error and detail fields, manifest HTTP status, browser-side manifest load time, manifest response cache headers, producer proof flags, a hands-on readiness panel for mouse-and-ears testing including phase, parameter timeline, and inspection hover-delta readiness, a compact sandbox contract summary, boundary flags, phase coverage, phase reports with explicit or derived time ranges plus hover probe and preview target, structured parameter resync values and change ratios, a read-only inspection cursor with state-styled header source/delta/preview/transport/target/divergence pills plus mirrored browser audio time and hover source/delta/frequency/amplitude/envelope values, live current-phase frequency/amplitude readouts, a phase-aligned parameter timeline with hover probe and preview target, decoded per-phase audio stats with measured frequency and peak deltas plus hover probe and preview target, producer-side phase audio measurements from the manifest with browser-visible verification state, the inline artifact manifest and text reports, artifact coverage including missing-path count, visible metadata-only artifact-packet reachability method, served artifact modified times, labeled reachable artifact links, non-clickable missing artifact paths, no-store local success and error responses, malformed manifest shape checks with sandbox handoff, phase audio measurement, and positive detailed WAV metadata requirements, source details, manifest error paths and roots, a waveform with current-phase, hover probe, visible phase-jump hover/focus preview, hover marker, sample-cursor, byte metadata, peak, RMS, min/max, DC offset feedback, a decoded level envelope with peak/RMS summary and hover probe, an X/Y signal plot with header summaries, hover probe, waveform-to-signal hover probe, signal-to-waveform hover probe, nearest frame/time/phase probe, nearest sample hover marker, resettable browser-local inspection preferences, selectable phase focus, trace/points mode, display scale, full/cursor window size, focused stats, lag, and current point readout derived from the decoded WAV, explicit follow/free view controls, browser-backed seekable audio, and the generated WAV through a browser-native audio control.

It also applies the current read-only consumer checklist in the browser, so unsupported contract or ownership states are visible as warnings.

## Run

Generate the current artifact packet from `soemdsp` first:

```powershell
C:\Users\argit\Documents\_PROGRAMMING\soemdsp\build-moved\examples\Debug\runtime_dsp_object_bound_wav_resync_demo.exe
```

Start the sandbox:

```powershell
python C:\Users\argit\Documents\_PROGRAMMING\soemdsp-sandbox\server.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

## Smoke Test

After generating the current `soemdsp` artifact packet, run:

```powershell
python C:\Users\argit\Documents\_PROGRAMMING\soemdsp-sandbox\scripts\smoke_test.py
```

The smoke test starts isolated local servers on automatic temporary ports, checks
the manifest endpoint, checks the root shell DOM contract, duplicate IDs, and
audio/waveform control attributes, checks static assets, checks the waveform
seek source contract, checks producer proof flags, checks the handoff contract and boundary flags, checks handoff artifact
references, checks artifact and phase coverage, checks every manifest artifact
link for reachability, checks report documents, checks hands-on readiness source
coverage, checks parameter resync summary
values, checks primary audio artifact reachability, WAV metadata, and byte-range
audio responses, checks producer-side phase audio measurements against decoded
consumer measurements, checks decoded phase frequency and peak amplitude against the manifest resync targets, checks
negative artifact handoff contract cases for entry point, audio, WAV path,
duplicate single-role artifact, and phase-report coverage mismatches, checks
negative phase-audio measurement contract cases for missing, mismatched, and
drifting producer values, checks negative parameter-resync contract cases for
missing, unchanged, invalid, and non-upward values, checks
expected error and forbidden path responses including encoded traversal, checks
that non-read methods are rejected by the read-only server, and verifies that
readable malformed manifest shapes still preserve source details for the browser
consumer. It also verifies local responses use no-store cache headers. It prints
grouped checkpoints so failures are easier to locate, including sub-checkpoints
for shell, static assets, manifest contracts, artifact reports, audio, and
server error responses.

## Boundaries

This shell is read-only.

It does not:

- instantiate DSP objects
- schedule processing
- mutate Circuit
- serialize project files
- own audio engine behavior
- own plugin behavior
