## Live Demo: http://soundemote.io/sandbox

Browser sandbox for trying `soemdsp` patching, generated artifacts, waveform
views, Render Sample, and Live Audio.

## Aliasing wars: the Surge Oscillator

This branch (`aliasing-wars`) is a dedicated workspace for anti-aliased
oscillator work, starting with `native_modules/surge_oscillator` — a
saw/square/tri/sine oscillator with hard sync.

**The problem.** Hard sync forces a slave oscillator's phase back to 0 every
time a master signal crosses zero going up. That forced reset is a
discontinuity injected mid-waveform, and rendering it naively (just snapping
`phase = 0`, with no correction) aliases badly — the classic harsh, digital
buzz under a sync sweep.

**The fix, in two parts:**

1. **PolyBLEP correction reused, not reinvented.** This sandbox's existing
   `polyblep.cpp` module already band-limits ordinary cycle wraps with a
   PolyBLEP correction. A sync-forced reset and a natural wrap are the same
   kind of event from the waveform function's point of view — phase lands
   near 0 — so `surge_oscillator.cpp` reuses the identical
   `polyBlep`/`polyBlepSquare`/triangle-integrator functions unchanged. Every
   reset, sync-forced or natural, gets band-limited for free.
2. **Sub-sample sync timing.** Sync input is read once per sample, but a real
   zero-crossing can happen anywhere within that sample. Instead of always
   resetting to exactly `phase = 0` (which quantizes sync timing to the
   sample rate and adds its own jitter/aliasing at high sync ratios), the
   module linearly interpolates the crossing time within the sample and
   starts the new cycle already `frac` of the way in — the same idea Surge
   and other analog-modeling synths use for sync-aware oscillators.

**Verified, not assumed.** The compiled `.wasm` is tested against a
Python + `wasmtime` harness exercising the real artifact directly (27
assertions: pool exhaustion, waveform selection, level scaling, edge-triggered
sync detection, and — the part that actually matters — proof that early vs.
late sync crossings within the same sample produce measurably different
output, confirming the sub-sample interpolation is doing real work and not a
no-op).

**Ports:** `0.1V/Oct` (pitch) and `Sync` (audio-rate signal; a rising
zero-crossing triggers the reset) in; `Out` (the selected waveform), `Saw`,
`Square`, `Tri`, `Sine` (always-on taps, like `polyblep.cpp`'s convention),
`Synced` (a one-sample-wide pulse on the sample where a sync reset fired,
for chaining/visualizing), and `Internal Sync` (the built-in master
oscillator's raw signal, for inspection) out. Native C++/WASM with a JS
fallback, wired into both the offline evaluator and the realtime audio
worklet.

**Built-in sync source.** Patching a real oscillator into `Sync` still
works, but most hard-sync sweeps don't need a second module just to get
one — the oscillator owns its own internal master oscillator (`Sync Freq`,
0–20000 Hz, same range as the audible `Frequency`). With nothing patched
into `Sync`, the internal oscillator's zero-crossings drive the exact same
sub-sample-interpolated reset path external audio would — a self-contained
hard-sync sweep with two knobs and zero patch cables. Patch something into
`Sync` and it takes over completely; the internal oscillator is a
convenience default, not an extra mandatory step.

# CLAP latency is compensated when Render Sample injects returned CLAP output.
# Finite CLAP tails can extend Render Sample up to the bounded tail limit; infinite tails remain metadata-only.
# CLAP state can be saved into patch JSON and restored into a new host instance when the plugin exposes clap.state.

Boundaries:

```text
The server only writes through explicit save/settings/audio helper routes.
Open Path is restricted to Downloads.
The browser patch graph is demo-scoped state.
The browser compiler is not the production soemdsp scheduler.
The WebUI does not instantiate real C++ DSP objects yet.
Patch files can save current module instances and settings.
Patch files cannot define new module types by themselves.
